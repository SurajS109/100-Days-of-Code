# 100 Days of Code
 
Hey everyone!

I'm excited to announce that I'm embarking on a 100 Days of Code challenge in Python! This challenge is all about committing to coding for at least an hour a day for the next 100 days. As a passionate coder, I'm always looking for ways to improve my skills, and I believe this challenge is an excellent opportunity for me to do just that.

Throughout this journey, I'll be tackling various coding projects and exercises that will help me expand my knowledge and experience in Python. I'll be documenting my progress, sharing my learnings, and giving updates on my journey on my LinkedIn profile.

I'm excited to challenge myself, learn new things, and improve my coding skills over the next 100 days. I'm confident that this challenge will not only help me grow as a coder but also make me more disciplined and committed.
